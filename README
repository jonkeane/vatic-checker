# Vatic checker
A simple web application that displays videos, and allows users to annotate them. It borrows heavily from [vatic](https://github.com/cvondrick/vatic) (especially the video interface), but does not connect to or use Amazon's Mechanical Turk at all.

# Setup
To install, `pip` should install all of the dependencies (though you will need to install ffmpeg separately)

```
pip install ./vatic-checker
```

# Configuration
Then you can use `checker init directory` to install a directory to server from. Edit `directory/config.py appropriately` as appropriate. Then edit and move `http.conf` to the correct directory for your system.

# Checker commands
TBD
